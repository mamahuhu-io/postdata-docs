If you're facing issues with Postdata, you can try the following steps to resolve them.

## Connectivity

If Postdata fails to send your request, it could be because you may be experiencing connectivity issues. Check your connection by attempting to open a page in your web browser.

## Firewalls

Sometimes firewalls may be configured to block non-browser connections. You might need to contact your network administrator so that Postdata can work seamlessly.

## Incorrect protocol

You might have specified the wrong protocol, check if you're using `https://` or `http://` in your URL or vice-versa.

## Postdata errors

It could also be possible that Postdata might be making invalid requests to your API server. You can confirm this by checking your server logs (if available). If you believe this is happening, do get in touch with the Postdata team.

## CORS restrictions

CORS or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security mechanism built into modern web browsers. It may cause the following error when testing API endpoints or some other API endpoints with Postdata.

This is because the API not sending the proper API headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) and can be solved in two ways.

1. Ask whoever manages the API to add CORS support.

## Something went wrong
